<center><img src="img/momos.jpg" width="300px" height="300px"><p><i><strong><h2>SPICY MOMOS</h2></strong></i></p><p><i><strong>Momo is traditional Bhutanese dish, we tend to make it in a big gathering especially children as they love making it. I have always made them since I was young and my kids have always enjoyed cooking and eating momos with me.
Combine 200g of all purpose flour with a pinch of salt in a bowl. Add water to make a dough. Separate the dough into about 1.5 cm balls, roll the balls into 10cm diameter. Should be thin, especially on the edges. In a different ball mix the cheese with finely chopped onion, garlic and a pinch of salt. Put heaped tea spoon full of mixture into the rolled dough. Wet the edges with water and seal the mixture, should look a bit like dumplings. Brush the steamer with oil, and steam the momos for 15 minutes and serve warm with some tomato ketchup or sweet chilli sauce. Kids love making this but more so eating.
You can also put grated cabbages and chopped coriander to the mixture, not all kids like coriander but it does taste nice with the cheese mixture.

This is then stuffed with fillings ranging from a basic potatoes and onions mixture, to more innovative chinese, jain versions etc. The tangy taste of chillies in vinegar and chaat masala is very enjoyable! one of the most interesting and practical snacks to devour on the go! Method
